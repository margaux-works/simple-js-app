# Pokédex - A Simple Javascript App

## Description

Pokédex is a simple web application that displays a list of Pokémon fetched from the PokéAPI. The app allows users to view a list of Pokémon and access detailed information for each Pokémon, including their name, type, height, and an image. The detailed information is displayed in a modal window, making it easy to explore each Pokémon's attributes.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in JavaScript and Full Stack Web Development at CareerFoundry.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.3.1
- List.js
- Color Thief
- PokéAPI
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Requirements

- The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
- The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
- The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
  demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
- The app must have CSS styling.
- The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
- The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
- The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
- The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
  touch interactions.
- The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
- The app must not throw any errors when being used.
- The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
  review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
  Web Hosting).
- The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
